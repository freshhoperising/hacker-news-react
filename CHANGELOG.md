- new gulpfile and updated build/dist structure
- added babelify, and combed through code converting to es6
- switched to eslint to work with es6
- removed personal mixins in favor of helper functions (which is all they were anyway)
- improved modal logic (what was I thinking...)
- removed jQuery and added bluebird for promises
- updated readme with Firebase rules
- improved overall readability, hopefully
